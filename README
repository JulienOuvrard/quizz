Example files for video quiz creation

The libs/ and metadataplayer/ dirs should be symlinked from metadataplayer sources
which are generated in metadataplayer/test after running the sbin/bin/compil.sh script.

The video URL can be specified through its URL http://comin-ocw.org/media/infol1/20131010-camera-reference.mp4
but it is advised to download it once and keep it in the directory as camera.mp4
